# Project Antebellum

Much like a contract, this section outlines goals and guidelines, in addition to the ones given in our project overview. My "Antebellum" helps me understand the task at hand, establish and commit to an "Essential" -- sometimes "Desired" and "Optimal goals beyond the MVP, assess benchmarks and timelines, and anticipate challenges.


Starting with:
## What are your GOALS for this project?

>   - Essential: at minimum what is required by project guidelines, 
>        code is clean and could be easily used by someone else,
>       break-points are correctly established and page is responsive
>    - Optimal: Added features render a professional user experience,
>       aesthetic is fully aligned with personal brand
>       added design elements for personalization

## Planning Ahead: Guideliens for Self

The planning:
- Benefit from an early start on getting organized:
    - Create documents, folders, and templates
    - Make a list of deliverables and prioritizing
    - Get familiar with the Project Worksheet early on
- Bookmarking useful resources and inspired projects to be easily referenced throughout execution  
- Do not neglect organization and more tedious tasks in favor of technical, it is important to present this project with context.

The works:
- Have wireframes done early, and map HTML elements with JS/CSS in mind- 
- Once the foundation is laid, start with the most difficult/important parts
- Run and debug frequently
- Frequent commits to git 
- Utilize external resources, but make sure all assets can be links

The design:
- Pick out fonts early, limit to 3:
    - Headers, texts, accents
- Create a theme
    - Select a color theme
        - No more than 2 + black/white or similar
- Choose illustrations that will tie in
- Filter the preview of your projects to avoid overwhelming flashes of color

The nitty-gritty:
- Map flex and grid elements, #physically MAP THEM!
- Clear naming and format on respective, HTML, JS, and JQuery elements
- Keep functions clean and reusable


## Time Management

- Schedule calendar time to check in with instruction team
    - Plan on covering, what is done, what is challenging, what is up next
    - Preferably the same time each day to mimic a daily stand-up meeting in a normal work environment
    - Schedule additional time for more in-depth reviews when necessary
- Organized ahead of time and set time blocks
- Break down project into smaller taks and assign them target-deadlines
- Plan on finishing "Essential" defined above at the 3-day mark to have time to develop "Optimal" and fix any bugs
